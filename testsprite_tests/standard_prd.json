  "product_overview": "Academeet is a real-time web application that streamlines professor-student consultations by letting professors publish availability windows which auto-generate 15-minute slots, and allowing students to book slots with a required pre-consultation agenda. Role-based access control and realtime slot status updates prevent double-bookings and ensure appropriate access for students and professors.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enforce strong role-based authentication and route protection so students and professors only access permitted interfaces.",
    "Allow professors to create availability windows that auto-generate contiguous 15-minute slots.",
    "Provide students a real-time slot grid with forced agenda validation (minimum 10 characters) before booking.",
    "Prevent double-bookings via atomic server-side checks and realtime updates (Supabase Realtime).",
    "Deliver a mobile-first, accessible UI using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn UI, and Zod validation."
